# Project Proposal for GIC Course: Identifying Prime Real Estate Locations

## Title
Discovering Prime Real Estate Hotspots through Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify the best places for real estate investment by analyzing key factors that influence property desirability. By leveraging data on the proximity of grocery stores, emergency services, and main roads, we will pinpoint the 'hot' areas for real estate. If time permits, we will also incorporate property prices and valuation trends to refine our analysis further.

## Objectives
1. To identify prime real estate locations based on the proximity to essential amenities and services.
2. To analyze the impact of accessibility to main roads on property desirability.
3. To assess the feasibility of incorporating property prices and valuation trends into the analysis.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather data on the locations of grocery stores, emergency services (hospitals, police, and fire stations), and main roads.
   - Collect property price and valuation data if time permits.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Use Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to map out the proximity of properties to the identified amenities and services.
   - Analyze the correlation between accessibility to main roads and property desirability.
   - (Optional) Implement property price and valuation analysis to identify trends and patterns.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Rank locations based on their desirability scores derived from the proximity analysis.
   - Validate the results by comparing with known real estate hotspots.
